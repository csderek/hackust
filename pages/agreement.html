              <h3> Collection of statistical information</h3>
              <br>
              FinAdvisor's MoneySmart website collects information, without
              identifying factors, for statistical and research purposes, and to
              help improve our tools. This information can include: <br>
              <br>
              The user's server address<br>
              The top level domain name e.g. .com or .gov etc<br>
              The date and time of the visit<br>
              The pages accessed and documents downloaded<br>
              Responses to questions<br>
              Items added to lists<br>
              The previous site visited<br>
              The type of browser used<br>
              For example, we may include your visit to our superannuation
              calculator in preparing aggregate statistical information such as
              '20% of the people who used FinAdvisor's MoneySmart superannuation
              calculator explored making extra contributions to their
              superannuation'.<br>
              <br>
              Other than for statistical purposes no attempt will be made to
              identify your visit or browsing activities except in the unlikely
              event of an investigation.&nbsp; In an investigation, a law
              enforcement agency may inspect the internet service provider's log
              files with a warrant.<br>
              <br>
              <h3>Collection, use and disclosure of personal information</h3>
              <br>
              FinAdvisor's MoneySmart will only retain your personal information
              with your consent, via a prominent button that you may choose to
              click.&nbsp; Any time this occurs, you will be informed of the
              purpose for which the information is being collected.<br>
              <br>
              FinAdvisor's MoneySmart will not disclose or distribute your
              personal information without your consent, except where required
              to by law, for example by court order.<br>
              <br>
              When you set up a personal profile in FinAdvisor's MoneySmart (so
              that you can save and retrieve your results for calculators and
              apps), or when you request subscription to our eNewsletter, you
              will only be required to supply your email address. All other
              details you might choose to supply are optional.<br>
              <br>
              Your email address will only be used for the purpose for which you
              provided it and will not be given to any outside party.<br>
              <br>
              You can amend all the information in your MoneySmart personal
              profile.<br>
              <br>
              <h3>Publishing unclaimed money data</h3>
              <br>
              Unclaimed money records are published on FinAdvisor's MoneySmart
              website so people can find their lost money.&nbsp; FinAdvisor
              offers a free service that people would otherwise be charged for
              by commercial money finding businesses. FinAdvisor is required or
              authorised by law to publish this information.<br>
              <br>
              <h3>Cookies</h3>
              <br>
              This website may use cookies (small pieces of information
              exchanged between your web browser and a website server) for
              online surveys.<br>
              <br>
              <h3>Internet security risks</h3>
              <br>
              FinAdvisor's MoneySmart website employs a range of security
              measures to protect against data breaches, including firewalls,
              security patches, regular security testing and data
              encryption.&nbsp; This website complies with the Australian
              Government Protective Security Policy Framework and Information
              Security Manual.<br>
              <br>
              As there may be security risks in sending information via the
              internet, you should assess these potential risks when deciding
              whether to use our online services.<br>
